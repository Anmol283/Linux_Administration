## Lab 8: Shell Scripting in Linux
## Objective
The objective of this lab is to practice writing shell scripts for retrieving system information and performing basic mathematical calculations. We will also learn how to use redirection operators to store command outputs into files.

## Commands Used
## 1. Printing System Information
We create a shell script to display system details such as the hostname, kernel version, CPU information, memory usage, and disk usage.

Shell Script: system_info.sh
